> ## Short Explanation

PreVue is a dating app that aims to offer a unique and innovative approach to online dating.

It focuses on providing users with a more authentic and genuine experience by showcasing video profiles instead of traditional text-based profiles.

This approach is designed to reduce the ambiguity and uncertainty often associated with online dating, allowing users to get a better sense of who someone is before deciding to connect. The app emphasizes creating more meaningful and transparent connections.
